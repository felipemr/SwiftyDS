### Time/Memory Complexity - Big O Notation
It is a way to generalize the **O**rder of growth of your algorithm. It is not an exact measurement, but a way to categorize your algorithm based on how it scales over different inputs. It helps to make performance and structure decisions over your algorithm to create the best possible program.
